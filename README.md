# Language Model on character level using Bigram Approach (using Statistic and Neural Network Approach).

# Description
Language Modelling is the process where we feed a given sequence to find the next word/token over a probability distribution of vocab to get
next word.

# Project Structure
1. Developed 2 versions of models using bigram approach (means created frequency count on the basis of how many times 2 tokens are coming together).
2. Version 1 is a basic Statistical approach developed using normalized distribution of the frequency count.
3. Version 2 is a basic neural network approach.
